About



Peshawar Stays is a web application designed to simplify the process of finding and booking accommodations in Peshawar, Pakistan. This project aims to provide a user-friendly platform for both travelers and property owners. Travelers can easily search for hotels, guesthouses, and other lodging options based on their preferences, while property owners can list their spaces and manage bookings efficiently.

The application addresses the need for a centralized and modern accommodation booking platform in Peshawar. It leverages modern web technologies such as React for the frontend, Node.js with Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database. Key features include user authentication, property listing management, search and filtering, booking management, and secure payment integration (future enhancement).

Peshawar Stays distinguishes itself by focusing on the specific needs of the Peshawar market, offering a localized experience with tailored features. It aims to bridge the gap between travelers seeking convenient lodging options and local property owners looking to expand their reach.
